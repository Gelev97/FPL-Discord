"""Fantasy Premier League news fetcher and Discord notifier.

This module fetches Fantasy Premier League news posts from the FantasyPL subreddit
and sends them to a Discord channel via webhook. It monitors posts with the "News"
flair within a specific time window (yesterday 6 PM to today 6 PM) and forwards
them to Discord with proper formatting.

Typical usage example:

    python fpl_news.py

Environment variables required:
    REDDIT_CLIENT_ID: Reddit API client ID
    REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET: Reddit API client secret
    REDDIT_USER_AGENT: Reddit API user agent string
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK: Discord webhook URL for sending messages
